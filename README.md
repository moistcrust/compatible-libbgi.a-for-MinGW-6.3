# libbgi for MinGW 6.3

This repository contains a **fixed version of libbgi** (Borland Graphics Interface) for **MinGW 6.3** on Windows. The `libbgi.a` library allows modern compilers to use the legacy **BGI graphics** functions, commonly used in old Turbo C++ and Borland C++ programs, while ensuring compatibility with newer systems and compilers such as **GCC**.

### Features:
- Provides compatibility for **BGI graphics** functions such as `initgraph()`, `circle()`, `line()`, etc.
- Specifically designed to work with **MinGW 6.3** and later versions on Windows.
- Includes necessary headers (`graphics.h`, `winbgim.h`) and a fixed static library (`libbgi.a`) to support graphics programming.

### Purpose:
The goal of this project is to make **BGI graphics** available for modern development environments without needing to rely on legacy tools like Turbo C++. It is ideal for educational purposes, hobby projects, or anyone looking to revive classic graphical programs from older compilers.

### Installation:

1. **Clone the repository:**
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/moistcrust/compatible-libbgi.a-for-MinGW-6.3.git
